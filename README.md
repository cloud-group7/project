# Cloud Computing Group 7 Project: Totally Legal Music Sharing Platform
This project was created as the final project for the University of Massachusetts Lowell Cloud Computing class.
This program runs as an AWS Lambda function, and allows users to upload music (that they obviously hold the copyright for) and it gets posted to
the home page so that other users can play those songs.
